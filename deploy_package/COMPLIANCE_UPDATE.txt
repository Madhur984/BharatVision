# 🎯 Compliance Checking - Updated to 6 Core Fields

## What Changed

Updated compliance validation to focus ONLY on the 6 mandatory Legal Metrology requirements:

### 6 Core Fields (Equal Weight - ~16.67% each)

1. **Manufacturer Name & Address**
   - Keywords: "manufactured by", "mfd by", "manufacturer", "marketed by"
   
2. **Net Quantity**
   - Keywords: "net qty", "net quantity", "net wt", "net weight", "contents"
   
3. **MRP (Maximum Retail Price)**
   - Keywords: "mrp", "m.r.p", "maximum retail price", "₹", "rs"
   
4. **Consumer Care Details**
   - Keywords: "customer care", "consumer care", "helpline", "contact", "email"
   
5. **Date of Manufacture**
   - Keywords: "mfg date", "mfd date", "manufactured on", "dom"
   
6. **Country of Origin**
   - Keywords: "made in", "country of origin", "manufactured in"

## Scoring

- Each field = 16.67 points
- Missing field = -16.67 points
- 100% = All 6 fields present
- 0% = No fields found

## What Was Removed

Removed checking for non-essential fields like:
- ❌ Ingredients (not always required)
- ❌ Best before date (only for certain categories)
- ❌ Import details (only for imported goods)
- ❌ Seller information (not mandatory)
